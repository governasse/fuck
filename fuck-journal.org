* Notes 
1. Hash cracking for $$ 

2. Online Hash search engines (just hash an input, and then perform a search)... 
2.1 this might be interesting to write a python script that scrapes a METRIC.SHIT.TON 
of password lists, parses them, and routes your input through all of them. 
2.1.1. graph db? (so as to interpolate hashes, regardless of algorithm?) 

3. use emacs-org-mode-export-to-html, to build an automated post-aurthoring system
to push to the git repo 

3.1 get hashcat ruinning on some gear 
3.1.1 dir traversal
3.1.2 Question: How does the TP-Link Tether App work?  

3.1.2.1 (data) I know that there is an ssh host, that 
acts as a local proxy for admining the router while away. 

3.1.2.1.1 Question: can I build a tether-like app?  
(that's essentially just what the website is)
